# Airport-Challenge-JS

Second JS based project, again another translation of previously completed work, this time using Jasmine as a testing framework. 

The idea was to learn how to:
-TDD in a new language by translating
-Learn that different languages are much more similar than they are different
-Learn how to use different languages to accomplish different tasks
